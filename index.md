## About

<img class="profile-picture" src="photo.jpg">

I am a doctoral student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the [Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/). My research interests are in social computing and natural language processing. I'm interested in understanding interactions among people, specially in the setting of online forums. 

I completed my masters at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) and, before that was an undergraduate at [Birla Intitute of Technology and Science, Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/).
